    message: "Comprehensive backend testing completed. The database collections exist in MongoDB but the application is not properly connecting to them. All endpoints that require database access are failing with 'NoneType' object has no attribute errors. This suggests that the database connection is not being properly initialized in the application. The health endpoints and QR code services are working correctly because they don't rely heavily on database access."
```

## Technical Details

### Working Components
- Health endpoints (/api/health, /api/qr/health)
- QR code services (generation, verification, scanning, refresh, multi-chain)
- Federated Learning model info endpoints
- IPFS retrieval endpoint

### Non-Working Components
- Blockchain integration (not connected to Polygon PoS)
- Product lifecycle management (database errors)
- Analytics and monitoring (database errors)
- Cross-chain messaging (database errors)

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue appears to be with database connectivity or initialization. Most endpoints are failing with errors like "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'products'" or "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'participants'", indicating that the database collections are not properly initialized or accessible.

The MongoDB database exists and has the required collections created, but the application is not properly connecting to them. This suggests an issue with the database initialization in the application code.

### Infrastructure Status
- Backend: Running on http://localhost:8001
- MongoDB: Running with all required collections created
- Frontend: Not tested as per instructions
