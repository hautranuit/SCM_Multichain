### ✅ **All Services Successfully Restarted and Working**
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:8001 ✅ 
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **MongoDB**: All collections accessible with proper async connections ✅
- **Smart Contracts**: All 3 contracts deployed and loaded ✅
- **Blockchain Service**: Connected to both Polygon PoS (80002) and L2 CDK (2442) ✅

### ✅ **All Route Dependencies Fixed**
Updated all route files to use proper async dependency injection:
- `/app/multichain-chainflip/backend/app/api/routes/blockchain.py` ✅
- `/app/multichain-chainflip/backend/app/api/routes/products.py` ✅  
- `/app/multichain-chainflip/backend/app/api/routes/analytics.py` ✅

## 🔧 **FIXED ISSUES**

### **Database Connection Singleton Pattern Fixed**
**Before Fix**:
```python
def get_database():
    global database
    if database is None:
        return init_sync_database()  # Wrong: Sync database returned
    return database
```

**After Fix**:
```python
async def get_database():
    global motor_client, database
    if database is None:
        motor_client = motor.motor_asyncio.AsyncIOMotorClient(settings.mongo_url)
        database = motor_client[settings.database_name]
        await motor_client.admin.command('ping')  # Test connection
    return database
```

### **Service Dependencies Updated**
All route dependencies changed from sync to async initialization:
```python
# Before: def get_blockchain_service(): return BlockchainService()
# After:
async def get_blockchain_service():
    service = BlockchainService()
    await service.initialize()
    return service
```

## 🔄 **AGENT COMMUNICATION**

### **Testing Agent (May 31, 2025)**
Comprehensive backend testing completed. All critical endpoints are working correctly after the database connection fix. The system is now 100% operational with all backend services functioning as expected.

**Test Summary**:
- All health endpoints working correctly
- Blockchain integration fully operational (both Polygon PoS and L2 CDK)
- Federated Learning system working (models not yet trained, but endpoints operational)
- QR code services fully functional
- IPFS integration working
- Analytics and monitoring endpoints operational
- Product lifecycle management fully functional

**Minor Issues (Non-Critical)**:
